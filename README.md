# Iflux POC APP

Iflux POC APP is an academic node.js REST service that implements the [Iflux specs](http://www.iflux.io/blog.html)


## Few words

Our team (Nicolas & Lukas) decided to build the project with [LoopBack](http://loopback.io) which is a totalty RESTful API framework on the top of express.

To run our projet, you need 

* Nodes.js

## Getting Started

This will install the LoopBack framework, the slc command-line and various tools such as Yeoman and Grunt*
* To start a new projet use `$ slc loopback`
* We will need the MongoDB connector, please note that a compiler is require to produce bson `$ npm install loopback-connector-mongodb â€“save`
* Configure MongoDB as datasource, use the loopback datasource generator that will write the settings in `/server/datasources.json` for you `$ slc loopback:datasource DB_name`
